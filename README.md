In Bangladesh, many individuals fail to undergo regular medical check-ups, a practice recommended by health experts to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Specifically, it is suggested to have check-ups once a year if over the age of 50, and once every three years for younger, healthy individuals. Unfortunately, this lack of regular health assessments has led to an increase in undetected malignant diseases such as breast cancer and skin cancer.  

Many individuals also hesitate to share unusual symptoms in certain body parts due to stigma or uncertainty about whether to consult a doctor. This hesitation, coupled with inadequate healthcare infrastructure, exacerbates the situation.  

### **Challenges in Healthcare**  
Bangladesh suffers from both a shortage and unequal distribution of healthcare resources. The country has an estimated 3.05 physicians and 1.07 nurses per 10,000 population, which is insufficient to meet the demands of its large population. Consequently, Bangladesh bears a significant burden of diseases that often go undiagnosed until advanced stages.  

### **Prottoy Health: The Solution**  
To address these challenges, **Prottoy Health** is designed as a mobile application that utilizes machine learning and image processing to identify detectable diseases, including breast cancer. The app analyzes symptoms or medical images to provide accurate disease detection and suggests necessary actions based on its analysis.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Early Disease Detection**: Leveraging advanced technologies to detect diseases at an early stage.  
- **Guidance for Users**: Offering recommendations on whether to consult a doctor based on detected symptoms or analysis.  
- **Cost-Effective Solution**: Providing affordable services by partnering with healthcare professionals and hospitals.  

### **Impact**  
An application like Prottoy Health can significantly benefit Bangladesh by addressing gaps in healthcare accessibility and promoting early detection. It empowers individuals with knowledge about their health while alleviating the burden on the healthcare system.  

Prottoy Health is a step toward a healthier future, enabling individuals to take proactive measures in disease prevention and management.
